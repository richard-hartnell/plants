# plants
a garden scripting station.


## The new version of the PLANTS sheet
Now with more dynamic behavior. Designed so I can quit Taskade.

### TODO LIST

- handle a table of plants and a table of plots.
- create a garden plan based on companion planting and rotation
- populate Google Calendar events with:
    - plantings
    - harvest dates
    - pruning
    - weeding tasks
    - hardening tasks
    - winterizing tasks
    - long-term plans

### The plan:

- bulid out the database from the PLANTS sheet
- build out the calendar functionality (add calendar events)
- create something like workshop_scheduler to plot plants?
- add a verison of bcg-emailer for extra harrassment
- integrate that companion planting sheet where each object can be mutually referred to
